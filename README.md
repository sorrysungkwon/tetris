| ~~v0.8~~ ✅ | Multi-track BGM (speeds up with level), combo flash, Glowtris full-screen effect |
| ~~v0.8.1~~ ✅ | Desktop UI redesign, tablet touch controls fix |
| ~~v0.9~~ ✅ | Online leaderboard (Upstash Redis), result share (Web Share API) |
| ~~v0.9.1~~ ✅ | Code optimisation, refactor, bug fixes, desktop leaderboard overlay fix |
| ~~v0.9.2~~ ✅ | iOS speaker fix, audio resume, danger warning overlay, SFX node cleanup |
| ~~v1.0~~ ✅ | All-clear bonus, NEW BEST effect, daily leaderboard, PWA, OG image — **LAUNCHED** |
| ~~v1.0.1~~ ✅ | Rename to Glowtris, variable clean up, and **Premium Visual Upgrade** (Color-shifting nebulae, Glassmorphism 3D panels, landing shockwaves, keyboard press feedback, and level-up sweep). |
| ~~v1.0.2~~ ✅ | **Elegant Polish**: Removed hard-drop shockwaves to keep drops snappy, added sleek vertical alignment lasers, added drop spark trails, and polished pause menu buttons. |
| ~~v1.0.3~~ ✅ | **Retention & UX Polish**: Username persistence, personal best streak & max combo badges, How To Play collapsible panel. |
| ~~v1.0.4~~ ✅ | **Profile, UI, & Social Depth**: Full stats screen, personal record badges, UI enhancements (neon grid, floating text, optimized particles), Weekly leaderboard tab, persistent rank display, and canvas share image. |
| ~~v1.0.5~~ ✅ | **OG Image Redesign**: Logo lockup layout (3×3 block grid mark + GLOW/TRIS neon title), nebula background, neon corner brackets, gradient separator lines. |
| ~~v1.0.6~~ ✅ | **Settings, Accessibility & Polish**: Ghost piece on/off toggle, lock-delay tuning in pause menu. Privacy Policy + Terms of Service pages (Donation-supported & 100% Ad-Free). Automatic performance mode — monitors FPS and disables glow/particles/nebulae below 30 FPS. |
| ~~v1.0.7~~ ✅ | **Keyboard Parallax & iPad Fit**: Left/right key input nudges the entire UI 2px in the opposite direction with a snappy spring-back (0.18s cubic-bezier). Screen shake locked to X-axis only. `overscroll-behavior:none` prevents page scroll on iPad. Game board shrunk by 8px margin so content never clips on iPad. |
| ~~v1.0.6 post~~ ✅ | **Code Quality & Mobile Fixes**: Refactor/clean-code pass (CSS consolidation, function extraction, variable shadow fix, removed WHAT comments, −114 lines). Touch control button order swapped: HOLD / DROP / ROTATE. Fixed mobile controls clipping on iOS PWA — `env(safe-area-inset-*)` returns 0 during synchronous script execution; added `requestAnimationFrame` re-layout so safe-area values are read after the first paint. Fixed oversized bottom margin on iPhone WebView — corrected `frameH` formula to `max(0,8−safeTop) + max(0,8−safeBottom) + 16` so safe-area padding is not double-counted (saves up to 24px on iPhone). Removed non-functional "TAP TO RESUME" label from pause overlay (no tap handler existed). Mobile start screen now uses full-screen dark/blur overlay (`position:fixed`) matching desktop/iPad, with panel centred in the full viewport. **Robust touch layout via ResizeObserver** — `#game-row` now uses `flex:1 1 0` to fill remaining space; `ResizeObserver` reads its actual rendered height and sets CELL, replacing all hardcoded `headerH`/`ctrlH`/`frameH` arithmetic so future CSS changes never break the bottom margin. |
| ~~v1.0.8~~ ✅ | **Accessibility & Visual Polish**: Colorblind mode — 7 unique white symbol overlays per tetromino (I=══ O=○ T=△ S=/ Z=\ J=║ L=✕), rendered on board, active piece, and next/hold previews. Animation intensity cycle (Full / Low / Off) disables particles, screen shake, flash, combo overlay, and rainbow border for motion-sensitive players. Both settings persist to localStorage. |
| ~~v1.0.8.1~~ ✅ | **Performance & Visual Overhaul**: Cell sprite cache — pre-renders each piece color once into an offscreen canvas and blits via `drawImage` (GPU path), eliminating ~400 `createLinearGradient` calls/frame. Baked glow — `shadowBlur` rendered into sprite pixels so all placed blocks glow at zero per-frame cost. Glow threshold `glow > 1.2` removes per-cell shadowBlur from board cells (200 ops/frame saved). Nebula bounding-box clip reduces fill area ~50%. CSS border/boxShadow cached — only updates on piece color change. Perf mode tuned: requires 2 consecutive bad seconds + 3s startup holdoff; sprites pre-warmed at game start. Refined neon color palette (J: `#0055ff`→`#2979ff` brightest win). Ghost piece quieted, glow rebalanced. **Bug fix**: `#overlay` moved to `<body>` level with `display:none` default — fixes blank start screen on Chrome Mac. |
| ~~v1.0.8.2~~ ✅ | **Perf Mode: Full UI Effect Kill + Bug Fixes**: Low-perf mode now strips every non-gameplay effect — static `#000010` background (no stars/nebulae), all CSS animations off (title, scale-pop, pulse badges), `#screen-flash` hidden, `comboFlash`/`rainbowBorder`/`dangerPulse`/`levelUpScanline` all bypassed, screen shake skipped, `triggerLevelUpVisuals` no-ops. Button effects disabled: `action-btn` hover glow/scale/shimmer-sweep off, `.tbtn` backdrop-filter and press glow off, pause-menu toggle-btn glow off. **Bug fix**: `nc`/`hc` undefined in desktop `initLayout()` — split-canvas refactor left two bare references; renamed to `ncD`/`ncM`/`hcD`/`hcM`. |
| ~~v1.0.9~~ ✅ | **Daily Challenge + Achievement System**: Date-seeded daily challenge — all players share the same piece sequence; one attempt per day (localStorage gate); dedicated Redis leaderboard (score-based, TODAY only); 🏅 challenge badge + special share card on game over. Achievement system — 20 milestones (first Glowtris, T-spin Triple, All-clear, Combo 10+, reach Level 15, 1000-line lifetime, etc.); unlock toast + particle burst on earn; badge gallery in STATS overlay; persisted to localStorage. |
| ~~v1.0.9.1~~ ✅ | **iOS PWA Canvas Sizing Fix**: Resolved cold-start canvas oversizing caused by late-resolving CSS `env()` variables on iOS PWA. Option A (pure arithmetic) merged — safe area values are now estimated per-device in JS using `navigator.standalone` + `screen.height`: Dynamic Island (ph≥852→59px), large notch (ph≥844→47px), small notch (ph≥780→44px), no notch (<780→20px), Face ID iPad (ph≥1100→24px). Android PWA / desktop rely on CSS env() which works correctly on those platforms. |
| ~~v1.0.9.2~~ ✅ | **BGM Upgrade + Challenge Background + Flash Fix**: Full BGM system with 3 synthwave tracks, dynamic intensity layers, volume fade in/out; Challenge mode gets distinct crimson/dark-red starfield background; hold `<canvas>` flash on game-over fixed. |
| ~~v1.0.9.3~~ ✅ | **T-Spin Mini + Leaderboard Dedup + OG Image**: T-Spin Mini detection (1 front corner = mini, score 0/200/400×level; 2 front corners = full T-Spin); leaderboard deduplication — same username keeps only personal best across all 5 boards; `/api/og` Edge Function generates 1200×630 PNG for Twitter/KakaoTalk/Discord/Line previews; soft-drop DAS fix (holding ↓ properly accelerates, lock timer not reset while grounded). |
| ~~v1.0.9.4~~ ✅ | **Hotfix — Hold/Next Panel Overflow + PC Perf**: Fixed hold/next canvas overflowing panel container on desktop (box-sizing:border-box → panel widened 132→150px, canvas dims passed correctly to drawMiniPiece). PC background gradient caching (every 4 frames), auto low-perf mode for Intel iGPU (WEBGL_debug_renderer_info), static gradient background in low-perf mode. |
